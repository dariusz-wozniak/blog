> Writing tests is another way to look the code and locally understand it and reuse it, and that is the same goal of good Object Oriented design. This is the reason of the deep synergy between testability and good design.

> Code without tests is bad code. It doesn’t matter how well written it is; it doesn’t matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don’t know if our code is getting better or worse.

> TDD does not drive towards good design, it drives away from a bad design. If you know what good design is, the result is a better design.

> TDD doesn't drive good design. TDD gives you immediate feedback about what is likely to be bad design.
 
<div style="text-align: right">— Kent Beck</div>

> The best way that I know to write code is to shape it from the beginning with tests.
 
<div style="text-align: right">— Ron Jeffries</div>

> TDD approach appears to yield code with superior external code quality, as measured by conformance to a set of black box test cases when compared with code developed with a more traditional waterfall-like model practice.

> TDD approach facilitates simpler design and that lack of upfront design is not a hindrance.

> Future releases of these products, as they continue using TDD, will also experience low defect densities due to the use of these test assets.

I jeszcze jeden, bardzo trafny w kontekście:

> No tool nor technique can survive inadequately trained developer.
